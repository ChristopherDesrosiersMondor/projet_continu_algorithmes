# Algorithms: Continuous project :round_pushpin:

## Description
This project allowed us to explore the behind the scenes of the most used algorithms in programming. As much the sorting and search algorithms as the design patterns and especially the data structures.

As part of this evaluation we carried out complexity analyzes and we had a general reflection on the behavior and the reason for being of each of the algorithms which are found in the files presented here.

## Use
You will be able to move through the file structure here and explore our presentation of each section with our in-depth analyzes for each algorithm implemented.
